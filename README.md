COVID-19 OVERTAKING WARN <br> DAISY WILLIAMS <br> https://daisywilliams.github.io/ny-warn-scraper/

### This year, the amount of notices to WARN regarding COVID-19 has surpassessed any other cause over the past 5 years. 

I've taken the data from 2015-2020, organized the dislocation portion into one of the following categories <br>  
Acquisition/Sale <br> 
Construction <br> 
Contract Loss/End <br> 
COVID-19 <br> 
Decline in Business with Major Customer <br> 
Economic <br> 
End of Lease <br> 
Merger <br> 
Operations <br> 
Other <br> 
Relocation <br> 
Restructuring <br> 
Transfer <br> 
Weather related <br>


Some major findings I have come across are : <br>
- Normally Economic is the number one reason
- The number one Economic cases in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 equal how many COVID cases there have been 
- Last years notices are nearly a quarter of the total of 2020's
